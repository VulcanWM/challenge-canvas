# Challenge Canvas 

**Challenge Canvas** is a simple, local progress tracker that lets you visually map your daily achievements as colourful post-it notes on a virtual board. Each note represents a “challenge day” and can include short text and an emoji. You can highlight important days, drag notes around, randomise their positions, and even export your board as a PNG.

# Why I Built This

I created Challenge Canvas as a personal reminder that **showing up consistently matters more than perfection**. In the past, I used to post my progress on Twitter for others to see, but now I wanted a **private, local tool** to track my journey without external pressure.

This project is part of my **“£100k before uni” challenge**, where I’m documenting my efforts to reach £100,000 before starting university. The main purpose of the board is to **help me stay motivated and organised**, while also giving a snapshot of my day-to-day progress.

You can follow along and read more about my journey in my [newsletter](https://100k-before-uni.beehiiv.com/)

# Setup


I haven't published this as a chrome extension, but using it locally is very easy and only a few steps.

## 1. Download
Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP". Make sure to extract the download in a safe spot!

## 2. Turn on developer mode
In your browser head to the "Extensions" section. This can be found in the settings portion of your browser! Check out the screenshot below:

Once you get there you'll see "Developer mode" in the top right. Make sure to toggle that on and then you'll see new options (we're gonna be using "Load unpacked")

## 3. Add the app to your browser
Last step! Press the "Load unpacked" option and then go to the folder where you saved Challenge Canvas. It should look something like this:

Once you select it you should see this (nice you did it!)

Now when you open the Challenge Canvas extension, you should see this:

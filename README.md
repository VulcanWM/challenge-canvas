# Challenge Canvas 

**Challenge Canvas** is a simple, local progress tracker that lets you visually map your daily achievements as colourful post-it notes on a virtual board. Each note represents a “challenge day” and can include short text and an emoji. You can highlight important days, drag notes around, randomise their positions, and even export your board as a PNG.

# Why I Built This

I created Challenge Canvas as a personal reminder that **showing up consistently matters more than perfection**. In the past, I used to post my progress on Twitter for others to see, but now I wanted a **private, local tool** to track my journey without external pressure.

This project is part of my **“£100k before uni” challenge**, where I’m documenting my efforts to reach £100,000 before starting university. The main purpose of the board is to **help me stay motivated and organised**, while also giving a snapshot of my day-to-day progress.
